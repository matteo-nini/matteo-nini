  <p><b>Hi, i'm Mattew</b> <sub><del>yes, it's an art name</del></sub></p>
  <h3> ðŸ¤“ About me ... </h3>
  <p>I completed my studies at a technical institute, obtaining a diploma as a computer expert. <br> I consider myself an enterprising, willing, punctual and helpful guy. Breezy and open to discussion, after my work experiences, I developed a very good ability to relate to the public and work in a team.</p>
<br>
<p>During my studies my passion for web development was born and I started to cultivate creativity, attention to detail and a certain aesthetic taste, which I always try to put into practice in whatever I do.</p>
